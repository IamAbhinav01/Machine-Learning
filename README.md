# MachineLearning

This repository contains code and notebooks for data preprocessing and regression models as part of machine learning projects.

## Contents

- **DataPreprocessing/**: Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing tasks, including handling datasets like Titanic.
- **Regression/**: Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various regression techniques such as Random Forest Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Support Vector Regression, and more.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the desired folder (`DataPreprocessing` or `Regression`).
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to explore data preprocessing and regression models.
4. Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed, such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, and `jupyter`.

## Future Updates

This repository will be regularly updated with new machine learning models and preprocessing techniques.
